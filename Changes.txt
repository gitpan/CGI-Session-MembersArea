Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Session::MembersArea.

1.11  Tue Apr 13 15:10:00 2004
	- Fix a typo in method load_profile. A hash key had a double underscore prefix instead of a single underscore

1.10  Tue Apr 13 13:29:29 2004
	- Bump the version number all the way from 1.00 to 1.10 to help warn users of the changes, particularly the
		changes in the names of 2 database columns in the 'user' table
	- Add 'use DBI;' to the list of used modules
	- Rename the 'user_name' column in the 'user' table to 'user_full_name'
	- Rename the 'user_name_key' column in the 'user' table to 'user_full_name_key'. These 2 column name changes,
		together, should make things clearer
	- Add a parameter called 'session_full_name_column' to the constructor so you can use a table with a column
		called something other than the (new) name 'user_full_name'
	- Rename the constructor parameter called 'session_username_column' to be 'session_key_name_column'. The default
		value of this parameter is 'user_full_name_key'
	- Change the 3 calls to the CGI object's method 'param'. Sometimes, when the value of a CGI form field is undef,
		and the CGI object's method 'param' is being called as part of the parameter list of some method, CGI.pm does
		not return undef, it actually deletes one (1) parameter from the parameter list, so all remaining parameters
		get shifted down one place
	- Add a key called 'full_name' to the profile returned by the 'load_profile' method
	- Flag Javascript::MD5 as a related module, not a required module
	- Properly document - in the POD and here - the keys to the profile returned by the 'load_profile' method
	- Clean up and clarify various other parts of the docs
	- Patch the demo in examples/ to match these changes
	- Summary of changes
